Project Name: "Bank Analytics"

ðŸ“ŒDescription:
Iâ€™ve worked on analyzing bank data using Excel to create a dashboard with five key performance indicators (KPIs). This involved cleaning the data, making visualizations, and building the dashboard. In the second phase, I used SQL to extract and handle data more effectively, helping to uncover useful insights. In the third phase I used visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau to make the data clear and uncover the insights through dynamic and interactive dashboards.

ðŸ’¡KPIs:
1) Year-wise loan Amount Statistic.
2) Grade and sub-grade wise Revolving balance by customer.
3) Customer verification status.
4) Loan status by state and month.
5) Last payment received compared to home ownership.

ðŸ”ŽMain Findings:
1) Total loan amount taken by customers have increased a lot over the last five years.
2) Customers with a B grade have the highest revolving balance, followed by A-grade customers.
3) About 68% of customers are verified, while 32% are not.
4) Arizona and California have the most customers who have fully paid off their loans, as well as those with charged-off and current loan statuses respectively.
5) Most of the last payments received w.r.t to home ownership were made in 2013.
